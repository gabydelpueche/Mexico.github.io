    <blockquote id="block"><em>Mexico. Our brother from another mother. A country, with whom, like it or not, we are inexorably, deeply involved, in a close but often uncomfortable embrace. Look at it. It's beautiful. It has some of the most ravishingly beautiful beaches on earth. Moutains, desert, jungle. Beautiful colonial architecture, a tragic, elegant, violent, ludicrous, heroic, lamentable, heartbreaking history. Mexican wine country rivals Tuscany for gorgeousness. Its archeological sites-the remnants of great empires, unrivalled anywhere.  Anthony Bourday, Late Chef and Travel Writer</em></blockquote>

            <h2>A Look Inside</h2>
            <p>Mexico, officially the United Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America. 
                It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala,
                Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico is known for its rich culture, ancient ruins, 
                dazzling beaches, and incredible cuisine. Tour Mayan temple ruins by day and indulge in fantastic food while listening to
                the rhythms of live music by night.</p>

            <h2>The Tourist Attraction</h2>
            <p>So important are Mexico's ancient Aztec and Mayan sites and historic colonial cities that many have been designated as 
                UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ensuring they'll remain unchanged for generations to come. Interestingly, these Mayan ruins
                – including places like Guanajuato, Chichén Itzá, and Uxmal – are often as popular as traditional beach vacation spots like Cancún, Puerto Vallarta, and Playa del Carmen.
                Topping the whole experience is the country's rich culture, a fascinating mix of native people, as well as colonial 
                influences from Spain, that shows up in everything from the country's culinary creations to its vibrant musical and dance
                traditions. It's also a country rich in flora and fauna, as it is spread across climate zones that encompass everything
                from arid deserts to lush tropical rainforests. To ensure you plan the very best Mexican travel itinerary possible,
